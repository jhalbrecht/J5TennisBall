    Questions


        on the button control I'm pressing less than the default 500ms 
        (or the 750ms I specified in a constructor ovrload)
        yet I'm still getting the 
                button.on("hold" ... event
    });

    The button is wired as the johnny-five documentation indicates. 
    I'm using a button on a sparkfun proto shield for testing. 
    later this will be replaced by the garage door opener and used for toast notification.

    I hope my robots.txt will block search indexing while in the early not ready for prime time
    stages of the project.

hmm thought my .gitignore would exclude the .min.js and .js.map from visual studio
